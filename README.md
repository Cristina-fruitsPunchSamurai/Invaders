# Invader Grid ðŸ‘¾

JavaScript application inspired by the space invader theme, the game generates a grid on which we can do pixel art. The user can choose the size of the grid and the color of the pixels.

Through this challenge I was able to practice Vanilla JavaScript (DOM Manipulation, Events, Loops, Conditions, Functions, Objects, etc.). Moreover, this was my first approach of code organizing and structuring by methods.

## Features
- Grid generation depending on the user input.
- Color picker to choose the color of the pixels.


## Technologies
JavaScript
HTML
CSS
